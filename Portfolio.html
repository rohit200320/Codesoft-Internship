        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Introduction:

Hello! I'm Rohit Phuge, an aspiring coder on a journey to explore the exciting world of programming. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to dive headfirst into the world of coding. As a beginner in this vast and ever-evolving field, I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to create meaningful and impactful digital experiences.


Coding Journey:

My coding journey began with simple HTML and CSS, where I discovered the power of turning a blank canvas into a visually appealing website. With each line of code, I felt a sense of accomplishment as my creations started to take shape. As I delved deeper, I started experimenting with JavaScript, learning to add interactivity and dynamic elements to my projects.</p>
